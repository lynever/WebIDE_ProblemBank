For every path in list, find unique substring of that path.\n * 2. Unique substring along with ellipsis is shortened path of that path.\n * 3. To find unique substring of path, consider every segment of length from 1 to path.length of path from end of string\n *    and if present segment is not substring to any other paths then present segment is unique path,\n *    else check if it is not present as suffix of any other path and present segment is suffix of path itself,\n *    if it is true take present segment as unique path.\n * 4. Apply ellipsis to unique segment according to whether segment is present at start/in-between/end of path.\n *\n * Example 1\n * 1. consider 2 paths i.e. ['a\\\\b\\\\c\\\\d', 'a\\\\f\\\\b\\\\c\\\\d']\n * 2. find unique path of first path,\n * \ta. 'd' is present in path2 and is suffix of path2, hence not unique of present path.\n * \tb. 'c' is present in path2 and 'c' is not suffix of present path, similarly for 'b' and 'a' also.\n * \tc. 'd\\\\c' is suffix of path2.\n *  d. 'b\\\\c' is not suffix of present path.\n *  e. 'a\\\\b' is not present in path2, hence unique path is 'a\\\\b...'.\n * 3. for path2, 'f' is not present in path1 hence unique is '...\\\\f\\\\...'.\n *\n * Example 2\n * 1. consider 2 paths i.e. ['a\\\\b', 'a\\\\b\\\\c'].\n * \ta. Even if 'b' is present in path2, as 'b' is suffix of path1 and is not suffix of path2, unique path will be '...\\\\b'.\n * 2. for path2, 'c' is not present in path1 hence unique path is '..\\\\c'.\n */\nconst ellipsis = '\\u2026';\nconst unc = '\\\\\\\\';\nconst home = '~';\nexport function shorten(paths: string[], pathSeparator: string = sep): string[] {\n\tconst shortenedPaths: string[] = new Array(paths.length);\n\n\t// for every path\n\tlet match = false;\n\tfor (let pathIndex = 0; pathIndex < paths.length; pathIndex++) {\n\t\tlet path = paths[pathIndex];\n\n\t\tif (path === '') {\n\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = `.${pathSeparator}`;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif (!path) {\n\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = path;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tmatch = true;\n\n\t\t// trim for now and concatenate unc path (e.g. \\\\network) or root path (/etc, ~/etc) later\n\t\tlet prefix = '';\n\t\tif (path.indexOf(unc) === 0) {\n\t\t\tprefix = path.substr(0, path.indexOf(unc) + unc.length);\n\t\t\tpath = path.substr(path.indexOf(unc) + unc.length);\n\t\t} else if (path.indexOf(pathSeparator) === 0) {\n\t\t\tprefix = path.substr(0, path.indexOf(pathSeparator) + pathSeparator.length);\n\t\t\tpath = path.substr(path.indexOf(pathSeparator) + pathSeparator.length);\n\t\t} else if (path.indexOf(home) === 0) {\n\t\t\tprefix = path.substr(0, path.indexOf(home) + home.length);\n\t\t\tpath = path.substr(path.indexOf(home) + home.length);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// pick the first shortest subpath found\n\t\tconst segments: string[] = path.split(pathSeparator);\n\t\tfor (let subpathLength = 1; match && subpathLength <= segments.length; subpathLength++) {\n\t\t\tfor (let start = segments.length - subpathLength; match && start >= 0; start--) {\n\t\t\t\tmatch = false;\n\t\t\t\tlet subpath = segments.slice(start, start + subpathLength).join(pathSeparator);\n\n\t\t\t\t// that is unique to any other path\n\t\t\t\tfor (let otherPathIndex = 0; !match && otherPathIndex < paths.length; otherPathIndex++) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// suffix subpath treated specially as we consider no match 'x' and 'x/...'\n\t\t\t\t\tif (otherPathIndex !== pathIndex && paths[otherPathIndex] && paths[otherPathIndex].indexOf(subpath) > -1) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst isSubpathEnding: boolean = (start + subpathLength === segments.length);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Adding separator as prefix for subpath, such that 'endsWith(src, trgt)' considers subpath as directory name instead of plain string.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// prefix is not added when either subpath is root directory or path[otherPathIndex] does not have multiple directories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst subpathWithSep: string = (start > 0 && paths[otherPathIndex].indexOf(pathSeparator) > -1) ? pathSeparator + subpath : subpath;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst isOtherPathEnding: boolean = paths[otherPathIndex].endsWith(subpathWithSep);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmatch = !isSubpathEnding || isOtherPathEnding;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// found unique subpath\n\t\t\t\tif (!match) {\n\t\t\t\t\tlet result = '';\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// preserve disk drive or root prefix\n\t\t\t\t\tif (segments[0].endsWith(':') || prefix !== '') {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (start === 1) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// extend subpath to include disk drive prefix\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstart = 0;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubpathLength++;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubpath = segments[0] + pathSeparator + subpath;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (start > 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = segments[0] + pathSeparator;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = prefix + result;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// add ellipsis at the beginning if neeeded\n\t\t\t\t\tif (start > 0) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = result + ellipsis + pathSeparator;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tresult = result + subpath;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// add ellipsis at the end if needed\n\t\t\t\t\tif (start + subpathLength < segments.length) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresult = result + pathSeparator + ellipsis;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = result;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif (match) {\n\t\t\tshortenedPaths[pathIndex] = path; // use full path if no unique subpaths found\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn shortenedPaths;\n}\n\nexport interface ISeparator {\n\tlabel: string;\n}\n\nenum Type {\n\tTEXT,\n\tVARIABLE,\n\tSEPARATOR\n}\n\ninterface ISegment {\n\tvalue: string;\n\ttype: Type;\n}\n\n/**\n * Helper to insert values for specific template variables into the string.

The fix is to detect this case and trying to watch the file\n\t\t\t\t\t// again after a certain delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t// In addition, we send out a delete event if after a timeout we detect that the file\n\t\t\t\t\t// does indeed not exist anymore.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tconst timeoutHandle = setTimeout(async () => {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst fileExists = await exists(changedFilePath);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (disposed) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn; // ignore if disposed by now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// File still exists, so emit as change event and reapply the watcher\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (fileExists) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonChange('changed', changedFilePath);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twatcherDisposables = [doWatchNonRecursive(file, onChange, onError)];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// File seems to be really gone, so emit a deleted event\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonChange('deleted', changedFilePath);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}, CHANGE_BUFFER_DELAY);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Very important to dispose the watcher which now points to a stale inode\n\t\t\t\t\t// and wire in a new disposable that tracks our timeout that is installed\n\t\t\t\t\tdispose(watcherDisposables);\n\t\t\t\t\twatcherDisposables = [toDisposable(() => clearTimeout(timeoutHandle))];\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange('changed', changedFilePath);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t// Folder\n\t\t\telse {\n\n\t\t\t\t// Children add/delete\n\t\t\t\tif (type === 'rename') {\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Cancel any previous stats for this file path if existing\n\t\t\t\t\tconst statDisposable = mapPathToStatDisposable.get(changedFilePath);\n\t\t\t\t\tif (statDisposable) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdispose(statDisposable);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Wait a bit and try see if the file still exists on disk to decide on the resulting event\n\t\t\t\t\tconst timeoutHandle = setTimeout(async () => {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmapPathToStatDisposable.delete(changedFilePath);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst fileExists = await exists(changedFilePath);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (disposed) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn; // ignore if disposed by now\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Figure out the correct event type:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// File Exists: either 'added' or 'changed' if known before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// File Does not Exist: always 'deleted'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlet type: 'added' | 'deleted' | 'changed';\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (fileExists) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (folderChildren.has(changedFileName)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttype = 'changed';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttype = 'added';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfolderChildren.add(changedFileName);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfolderChildren.delete(changedFileName);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttype = 'deleted';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonChange(type, changedFilePath);\n\t\t\t\t\t}, CHANGE_BUFFER_DELAY);\n\n\t\t\t\t\tmapPathToStatDisposable.set(changedFilePath, toDisposable(() => clearTimeout(timeoutHandle)));\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t// Other events\n\t\t\t\telse {\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Figure out the correct event type: if this is the\n\t\t\t\t\t// first time we see this child, it can only be added\n\t\t\t\t\tlet type: 'added' | 'changed';\n\t\t\t\t\tif (folderChildren.has(changedFileName)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttype = 'changed';\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttype = 'added';\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfolderChildren.add(changedFileName);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange(type, changedFilePath);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t} catch (error) {\n\t\texists(file.path).then(exists => {\n\t\t\tif (exists && !disposed) {\n\t\t\t\tonError(`Failed to watch ${file.path} for changes using fs.watch() (${error.toString()})`);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\treturn toDisposable(() => {\n\t\tdisposed = true;\n\n\t\twatcherDisposables = dispose(watcherDisposables);\n\t});\n}\n","/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *  Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
